### Tofu is the best.

Tofu makes you a better person.

Here is a description of this heavenly nectar from wikipedia on [Tofu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu): 

> Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a food prepared by coagulating 
> soy milk and then pressing the resulting curds into solid white 
> blocks of varying softness; it can be silken, soft, firm, extra 
> firm or super firm. Beyond these broad textural categories, 
> there are many varieties of tofu. It has a subtle flavor, 
> so it can be used in savory and sweet dishes. It is often 
> seasoned or marinated to suit the dish and its flavors, and 
> due to its spongy texture it absorbs flavours well.
